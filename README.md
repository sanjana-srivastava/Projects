# Sanjana Srivastava's Project Repository
This repository contains a collection of projects completed by Sanjana Srivastava during her academic journey in Aerospace Engineering.

## Projects Included
### Solar Sail Trajectory Optimization for an Earth-Saturn Mission:
Generated a time-optimal trajectory in MATLAB for an Earth to Saturn interplanetary mission powered using solar propulsion. The goal was to minimize fuel constraints for interplanetary missions and help understand the structure of the heliosphere for future missions to Jovian planets.
### Spacecraft Optimal Docking Procedure Using LQR and Moving Targets: 
Designed and implemented a controller for a spacecraft docking procedure using a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) in MATLAB. The docking algorithm was tested across three different optimal trajectory scenarios.
### Simplified 6-DOF Trajectory Simulations for Stardust SRC and Space Shuttle: 
Developed a six degree of freedom model of trajectory simulations for Stardust SRC and NASA's Space Shuttle and solved it through numerical integration in Python.
### Heuristic Algorithms used in Multidisciplinary Design Optimization: 
Analyzed and compared the application of three heuristic algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing) to minimize the mass of a trilobed airship. Used MATLAB to formulate the objective function and fine-tune the hyperparameters of each algorithm. Tabulated and compared the results to analyze the efficiency of each algorithm applied to the design problem.

## Skills Demonstrated
These projects aim to demonstrate proficiency in the following skills:

Programming languages: MATLAB, Python
