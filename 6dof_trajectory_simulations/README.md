# Simplified 6-DOF Trajectory Simulations for Stardust SRC and Space Shuttle
This project aims to develop a simplified six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) model for atmospheric reentry trajectory simulations of the Stardust Sample Return Capsule (SRC) and NASA's Space Shuttle. The equations of motion are derived, coded in Python, and solved using numerical integration. The results are then compared with existing literature to validate the simulations.

## Overview
The project focuses on understanding the various aspects involved in mission trajectory optimization, including deriving relevant equations, procuring accurate aerodynamic and structural databases, and solving the equations of motion to achieve accurate trajectory simulations. Trajectory optimization is a complex engineering problem, and this work contributes to the ongoing efforts in improving precision and accuracy in mission design.

## Features
6-DOF Equations of Motion: Implements a simplified, decoupled version of the 6-DOF equations of motion for atmospheric reentry.
Stardust SRC Simulation: Simulates the reentry trajectory of the Stardust Sample Return Capsule, which carried samples from comet Wild-2.
Space Shuttle Simulation: Simulates the reentry trajectory of NASA's Space Shuttle, a partially reusable low-Earth orbit spacecraft.
Numerical Integration: Solves the equations of motion using numerical integration (RK45 method) in Python.
Aerodynamic Data: Incorporates aerodynamic data (lift and drag coefficients) from existing literature for accurate simulations.
Result Validation: Compares the obtained results with published literature to validate the simulations.
